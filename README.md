# Next.js Course Implementation - Tickets 5 & 6

## Course: Mastering Next.js 13 with TypeScript
**Instructor**: Mosh Hamedani  
**Current Ticket**: 5  
**Repository**: `Tkt_005`

## üå≥ Git Workflow - Breaking the Main Branch Habit

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# For learning sections
ticket-5/section-{number}-{topic}
ticket-5/exercise-{number}

# For features (Ticket 6)
ticket-6/feature-{name}
ticket-6/bugfix-{issue}
```

### Current Branch Strategy
```bash
# Start new section
git checkout -b ticket-5/section-1-introduction

# Make changes and commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Section 1: Understanding SSR concepts"

# Push to remote when ready
git push -u origin ticket-5/section-1-introduction

# Create PR for review and merge to main
```

### Active Branches
- `main` - Stable, reviewed content
- `ticket-5/section-1-introduction` - Currently working (YOU ARE HERE)

### Quick Terminal Commands
```bash
# Essential commands for parallel terminal
git checkout ticket-5/section-1-introduction  # Switch to learning branch
git branch --show-current                      # Verify you're on right branch
git status                                      # Check what's changed
git add . && git commit -m "Section 1: [topic]" # Save your progress
git push                                        # Backup to remote
```

## üí° Philosophical Approach
*"It may get easy to be lost in the tooling terms... Understand what each tool is trying to DO. What functionality they ADD. This will be groundbreaking for both your technical knowledge and thinking."*

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Complete current ticket objectives
2. Understand tool purposes, not just syntax
3. Build with intention and understanding
4. Document learnings for future reference
