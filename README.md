  - [ ] Route groups
  - [ ] Parallel routes (optional)
  
- [ ] **Components Architecture**
  - [ ] Server components (default)
  - [ ] Client components ("use client")
  - [ ] Component composition
  - [ ] Props and children patterns
  
- [ ] **Data Fetching**
  - [ ] Server-side data fetching
  - [ ] Async components
  - [ ] fetch() in server components
  - [ ] Static vs dynamic rendering
  
- [ ] **Layout System**
  - [ ] Root layout
  - [ ] Nested layouts
  - [ ] Metadata API
  - [ ] Template vs layout
  
- [ ] **Loading & Error Handling**
  - [ ] loading.tsx files
  - [ ] error.tsx boundaries
  - [ ] not-found.tsx pages
  - [ ] Suspense boundaries
  
- [ ] **Styling (Basic)**
  - [ ] CSS Modules
  - [ ] Global styles
  - [ ] CSS-in-JS basics
  - [ ] *Note: Tailwind comes in Ticket 6*

#### API Development
- [ ] API routes in App Router
- [ ] Route handlers (GET, POST, etc.)
- [ ] Request/Response handling
- [ ] TypeScript with API routes

### 🔑 Key Takeaways from Mosh

#### React → Next.js Mental Model Shift
> "It's not just React with routing"

- **Server-First Thinking**: Default to server components
- **File System as Router**: The directory structure defines your routes
- **Full-Stack in One**: API and frontend in the same project
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image, font, and script optimizations

#### Component Philosophy
> "Don't make everything a client component"

- Server Components = Data fetching, large dependencies
- Client Components = Interactivity, browser APIs, event handlers

#### Best Practices
1. **Loading states are not optional** - Always provide feedback
2. **Understand before you copy** - Know why code works
3. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer early
4. **Type everything** - TypeScript is your friend

**Legend**: ✅ Complete | 🔄 In Progress | ⏳ Pending | ❌ Blocked

### 🛠️ Current Implementation

#### Today's Focus
- **Working on**: Documentation structure
- **Next up**: Project initialization
- **Blocker**: None

#### Recent Accomplishments
- Created documentation structure
- Set up learning tracking system

### 📝 Important Notes

#### Server Components (Default)
```tsx
// No "use client" directive needed
async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetchData(); // Direct async/await
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

#### Client Components
```tsx
"use client"; // Required directive

import { useState } from 'react';

function ClientComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  // Can use hooks, event handlers, browser APIs
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
}
```

### 🚧 Common Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution | Prevention |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Components not rendering | Check server/client boundaries | Plan component architecture first |
| Hydration errors | Ensure consistent server/client render | Avoid date/random in initial render |
| Route not found | Verify file naming (page.tsx) | Follow naming conventions strictly |
| Data not loading | Check async/await in components | Use proper loading states |

### 🎬 Before Moving to Ticket 6

**Must Understand**:
- [ ] Why Next.js over plain React
- [ ] Server vs Client component trade-offs
- [ ] When to fetch data where
- [ ] How layouts and pages compose
- [ ] Error boundary hierarchy

**Must Complete**:
- [ ] All routing patterns implemented
- [ ] Both component types mastered
- [ ] Data fetching patterns clear
- [ ] Loading/error states working
- [ ] Basic styling applied

### 🔮 What's Next: Ticket 6 Preview

After mastering Ticket 5 fundamentals, Ticket 6 will add:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling system
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database ORM
- **NextAuth**: Authentication solution

> "We're dancing in the realm of full-stack now" - Ticket 6

But first: **Master these fundamentals!**

### 💡 Philosophy
*"Understand what each concept is trying to DO. What functionality it ADDS. This will be groundbreaking for both your technical knowledge and thinking."*

**Daily Question**: What did I learn today that I didn't know yesterday?

**Remember**: The journey from Ticket 5 to Ticket 6 is about building a strong foundation first, then adding powerful tools with understanding.
