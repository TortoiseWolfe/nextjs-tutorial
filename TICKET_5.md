- `src/` directory? ‚Üí **No** (keeps structure simple)
- App Router? ‚Üí **Yes**
- Customize import alias? ‚Üí **No**

**Navigate to project:**
```bash
cd next-app

  const data = await fetch('/api/data');
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

// Client Component (Interactive)
"use client";
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;

## Key Takeaways from Mosh

### On Next.js Benefits
- "SSR makes applications faster and more search engine friendly"
- "Smaller bundle sizes with server components"
- "Better resource management on the client"

### On Component Strategy
- "Server components are the default for a reason"
- "Client-side navigation reduces server requests"
- "TypeScript catches errors before runtime"

### On Development
- "File-based routing eliminates configuration complexity"
- "The app router provides better code organization"
- "Next.js handles the heavy lifting of optimization"

## Hands-On Exercises from Video
1. Create a users page that fetches data
2. Implement loading and error states
3. Style components with different approaches
4. Build navigation with active states
5. Convert client components to server components

## Common Issues Addressed
- TypeScript configuration
- Module resolution
- Client vs Server component errors
- Hydration mismatches
- CSS Module imports

## Checklist Before Moving to Ticket 6
- [ ] Understand App Router structure
- [ ] Can create server and client components
- [ ] Know when to use which component type
- [ ] Comfortable with file-based routing
- [ ] Can fetch data on the server
- [ ] Understand caching basics
- [ ] Have tried all styling approaches
- [ ] TypeScript types are working

## Learning Notes & Insights
*Document observations and "why" explanations as you watch*

### Setup & Teaching Choices Explained
- [x] **Why no src directory**: Keeps tutorial simple, reduces file nesting, shorter paths in demonstrations
- [x] **Why no Tailwind initially**: Teaches styling progressively - CSS Modules first, then Tailwind to show evolution
- [x] **Why TypeScript**: Industry standard, catches errors early, better learning experience
- [ ] **When to use server vs client components**: (Document as you learn)
- [ ] **Performance implications**: (Note differences as demonstrated)
- [ ] **File organization patterns**: (Observe how Mosh structures the app)
