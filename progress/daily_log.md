3. How do error boundaries propagate?

#### Resources Consulted
- Next.js documentation
- Course materials
- Created comprehensive documentation

#### Tomorrow's Plan
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Create basic routing structure
3. Implement first server component

#### Confidence Rating

## Tips for Effective Logging

1. **Be Honest**: Record actual struggles and victories
2. **Be Specific**: Include code examples and exact errors
3. **Be Reflective**: Think about why things work, not just how
4. **Be Consistent**: Log daily, even if brief
5. **Be Forward-Looking**: Always plan tomorrow

## Question Bank

Questions to ask yourself each day:
- What surprised me today?
- What would I do differently?
- What pattern am I seeing repeatedly?
- How does this connect to what I already know?
- What would Mosh emphasize about this?
- Am I understanding the 'why' not just the 'how'?

*"Understand what each concept is trying to DO. What functionality it ADDS."* - Mosh
